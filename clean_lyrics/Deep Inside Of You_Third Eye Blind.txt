met light shed thoughts free flow said youve got something deep inside wind chime voice sound sway hips round rings true goes deep inside secret garden beams changed life seems fall breeze blows outside dont break stride thoughts warm go deep inside never felt alone til met friends say ive changed dont listen cause live deep inside slide dress shouts darkness im alive im deep inside said boy make girl feel good still deep inside still ive never felt alone til met im right met id know knew whats coming would change could id walk people could find id say im sorry im sorry dont want call want call cause dont want crush feel like crushing true took granted breathe looks look right broke didnt know broke didnt know broke didnt know might also like somethings gone withdraw im strong like deep inside go nowhere burn candles stare ghost deep inside great need starts bleed ive lost theres nothing left gone deep inside deep inside deep inside
