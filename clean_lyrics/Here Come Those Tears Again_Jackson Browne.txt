come tears getting going make another night without missing thinking might strong enough hear footsteps echoing hall baby stand weve many times even though looked sure watching walking door always walk back like today acting like never even went away well dont know open let baby come tears come tears hear telling needed free things work alone youre standing telling grown come tears dont know youll tell hold open let come tears come tears time baby im strong im feeling fine maybe look without crying might look like friend mine dont know open enough let come tears come tears dont know walk away open enough let im going back inside turning light come tears ill dark youll sight come tears might also like dont know open let baby come tears come tears
