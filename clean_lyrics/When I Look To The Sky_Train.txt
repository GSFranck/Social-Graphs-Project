rains pours opens doors floods floors thought would always keep us safe dry midst sailing ships sink lips ones love say goodbye float along ocean feel like notion wont seem let go look sky something tells youre make everything alright feel like im lost something tells youre always find way every word didnt say caught busy day every dance kitchen floor didnt every sunset well miss ill wrap kiss pick sail away float upon ocean feel like notion hope never leave cause look sky something tells youre make everything alright feel like im lost something tells youre always find way whether plane overhead instead feels like impossible fly spread wings see everything life may send hoping wont pass feel like one ever know show look sky something tells youre make everything alright feel like im lost something tells youre right next always find way always find wayyou might also like
