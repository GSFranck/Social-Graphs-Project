didnt hear cry morning didnt feel weep teardrops flowin like rivers sleep dream laughter came creepin fears telling sorrows tracings tears thats strange way tell love sorrow see want cry somebody dont cry dont cry didnt hear voice morning didnt call name heard whisper softly words never plain dream darkness came shinin like sun waiting laughter laughter never comes thats strange way tell love sorrow see want cry somebody dont cry dont cry didnt feel alone morning didnt need friend darkest hour came runnin back thats strange way tell love thats strange way tell love thats strange way tell love meyou might also lik
