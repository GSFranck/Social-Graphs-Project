could see beauty wonder wrapping around alone dreaming oh could imagine dream coming true much joy touched make feel everything much chorus love earth feet love sun sky love falling rain love heart could break love dreams share love falling rain facing wind tears eyes baby hoping waiting pull back door take hand lead whole world stranger opened heart everything chorus spoken like whisper dream youve walked softly life love sweet emotion gaze eyes see beauty god created love girl forever might also likechorus x
