looked gone youre looking back searching way like im back knew somehow city doesnt look id give life one night hold tight oh please take oh oh remember loved time day said goodbye remember every moment endless summer nights still recall walks along beaches way hair would glisten sun rising afternoon making love moon oh remember nights spent silence every single breath took mine say youll sun brings heart mine oh oh chorus theres much say please dont run away together tonight lets stay lost flight oh wont please surrender chorus outyou might also lik
