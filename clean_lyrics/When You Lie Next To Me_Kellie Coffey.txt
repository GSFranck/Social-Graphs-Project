maybe tonight could close door lock inside take time feel dont want miss chance real days fly away forget truth everything matters room lie next breathing air breathe dont speak loves precious thing dont want waste day one minute without life sweet lie next heart every part still wants give time love cos never know life leave us want take beauty oh let world around us disappear lie next breathing air breathe dont speak loves precious thing dont want waste day one minute without life sweet lie next oh lie next lie next breathing air breathe dont speak loves precious thing dont want waste day one minute without life sweet lie next might also likewhen lie next
