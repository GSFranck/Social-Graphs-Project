trouble rise didnt say word saw eyes opened soul showed view inside im proud say loud im happier cried shield misty gray well gladly leave behind restless youth gave way truth peace mind well ride wings love maze tears gone good riddance pain knew new days finally dawned dont wan na run life wan na share space wan na one puts smile upon face friends come go dont mind role play im sad say small compared people always talk dont care smaller minds youll always find nothing else oceans rise fall meadows washed rain cast aside tears cried lived love told ill tell make mistakes thats takes life fools im happier find us could grow mistakes made turn page cuz life goes know dont wan na run life wan na share space let one puts smile upon face im happier know im happier see open every door inside lives still free dont wan na run life wan na share space wan na one puts smile upon faceyou might also lik
