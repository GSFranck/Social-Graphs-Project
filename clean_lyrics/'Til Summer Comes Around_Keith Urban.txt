another long summers come gone dont know always ends way boardwalks quiet carnival rides empty broken heart tonight close eyes one time spinning around youre holding tightly words came kissed mouth fourth july ever burned brightly go understand promised youd back wander round town til summer comes around got job working old park pier every summer five long years grease gears fix lights tighten bolts straighten tracks count days til might come back close eyes one time spinning around youre holding tightly words came kissed mouth fourth july ever burned brightly go understand swore youd back im frozen town til summer comes around comes around oh close eyes stuck ferris wheel rocking motion hand hand cried laughed knowing love belonged us girl moment baby ill back whispered ear winter wind sound everything closing til summer comes around comes around might also like til summer comes around yeah mmm til comes around til comes around whew whew whew
