even though moment passed still cant turn away cause dreams never thought youd lose tossed along way letters never meant send get lost thrown away grownup orphans never knew names dont belong one thats shame could hide beside maybe wont tell one name wont tell em name scars souvenirs never lose past never far lose somewhere get star dont make sad know life grew way fast theres nothing believe reruns become history tired song keeps playing tired radio wont tell one name wont tell em name wont tell em name wont tell em name think time dont need lonely come back wont tell em nameyou might also like
