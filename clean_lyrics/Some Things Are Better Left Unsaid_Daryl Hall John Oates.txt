feel like could run away looking darker day oh im pulling shades away eyes true moody manners come go better never know things better left unsaid strings better left undone hearts better left unbroken lives better left untouched lies better believed words better left unspoken ideas seem frighten really afraid move oh guess right reason im still dealing force thats strong force stringing us along things better left unsaid strings better left undone hearts better left unbroken lives better left untouched lies better believed words better left unspoken youre livin lie thats thing say ooh things better left things better left unsaid strings things better left unsaid lives better things better left unsaid hearts better things better left unsaid lies better things better left unsaid things better left things better left unsaid strings things better left unsaid lives better things better left unsaid hearts better things better left unsaid lies better ooh things better left unsaid things better left things better left unsaid strings things better left unsaid lives better things better left unsaidyou might also lik
