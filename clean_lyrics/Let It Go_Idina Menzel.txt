snow glows white mountain tonight footprint seen kingdom isolation looks like im queen wind howling like swirling storm inside couldnt keep heaven knows tried dont let dont let see good girl always conceal dont feel dont let know well know let go let go cant hold back anymore let go let go turn away slam door dont care theyre going say let storm rage cold never bothered anyway funny distance makes everything seem small fears controlled cant get time see test limits break right wrong rules im free let go let go im one wind sky let go let go youll never see cry stand ill stay let storm rage might also like power flurries air ground soul spiraling frozen fractals around one thought crystallizes like icy blast im never going back past past let go let go ill rise like break dawn let go let go perfect girl gone stand light day let storm rage cold never bothered anyway
