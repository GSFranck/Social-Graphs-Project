secret best friend never knew brook told trees trees told breeze love trees told flowers hiding hilltop clouds told moon shone angry yet blue found heart another love brook became angry changed river rushing madly along soft summer breeze played tag trees became wild strong bashful white flowers hiding hilltop grew dark rain came pouring hearts couldnt hide tears cried carpeted ground storm passed gone theres sunshine chains held gone trees wave hello stand brook sings sweetest song bashful white flowers hilltop sun moon still friends promise therell heartaches till fall love againyou might also lik
