time broken hearts broken dreams place could wish four leaf clover new time new place dreams cant come true started day left could never love way loved could never cry like left said goodbye oh look eyes left beside without heart without heart could never love apart sorry late turn around tell reason reason foolish beat heart oh cant see im fooling nobody dont see tears falling face since went away break heart slipped away didnt know wrong never meant hurt youre gone might also likei could never love apart apart could never love apart
