passing time runaway moon talkin wishing somewhere else long since held girl twice thousand miles heart wont beat alone need love left behind hold back dawn awhile work dont let dream die theres fire sky like light eyes thinkin wont give till arms never give till whats lost found wont give sweet sweet love night dark diamonds im standing inside rain giving love worst mistake made theres sound hear distance seems calling name well ill pay price hope im late turn back clock awhile things work thats dream theres fire sky like light eyes oh true wont give till arms never give till whats lost found wont give sweet sweet love turn back clock awhile things work thats dream see fire sky like light eyes thinkin wont give till arms never give till whats lost found wont give sweet sweet loveyou might also lik
