walkin barefoot stream come unto hair softly fallin face dream time time grass wont pay mind sayin nothin lyin sun bakin upon sighs lips touch soft wet kisses hands gentle reply time time grass wont pay mind child touch soul cries music know found hear hundred goodbyes today hear one sound moment livin na na na na na na young bird flyin soft wind blowin cools sweat inside palms close eyes see flowers growin lay sleepin arms time time grass wont pay mindyou might also lik
