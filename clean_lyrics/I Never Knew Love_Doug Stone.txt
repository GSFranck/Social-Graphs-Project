never knew power song heard music playing day mama passed never knew innocence til first time laid eyes face newborn child never knew love mean real love never knew kind love til moment never understood meaning home til pulled old dirt drive bein gone long didnt know serenity really til stopped one day listen river gently run never knew love mean real love never knew kind love til moment ive known hunger tonight love felt yearning felt fire touch goes deeper thing ive ever known beyond heart clear soul never knew beauty could behold til looked could see forever unfold oh made whole never knew love mean real love never knew kind love til moment til loved youyou might also lik
