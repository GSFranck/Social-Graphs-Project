winters day deep dark december alone gazing window streets freshly fallen silent shroud snow rock island ive built walls fortress steep mighty none may penetrate need friendship friendship causes pain laughter loving disdain rock island dont talk love well ive heard word sleeping memory wont disturb slumber feelings died never loved never would cried rock island books poetry protect shielded armor hiding room safe within womb touch one one touches might also like rock island rock feels pain island never cries
