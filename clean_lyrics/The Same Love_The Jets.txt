love forever thats thought still remember words said said wed always together alone tonight something changed dont feel ill never understand love made happy make sad dont understand could eyes used laughing cry night doesnt seem right remembering nights held onto times told youll never love another remembering ever needed need summer days left standing rain somebody tell might also like heart blind couldnt see fool believe promises made went wrong went wrong doesnt seem right
