much believe lost time everything needed feel eyes always thought keeping heart next mine seems far away dont know love could leave without trace silent hearts go heart beat sound echoes night heart beat cant live without without feeling inside lonely hearts go candle water drifting helplessly hiding thunder come rescue driven hunger endless dream im searching hand hold im reaching arms let know silent hearts go heart beat sound echoes night heart beat cant live without without feeling inside lonely hearts go one touch overcomes silence love still survives two hearts needing one another give wings fly heart beat sound echoes night heart beat cant live without without feeling inside might also like need someone give heart feel getting stronger stronger stronger feel inside hearts made last till end time
