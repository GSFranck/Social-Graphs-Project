touch silver eyes blue oh need faithful always true oh love sweet possession dont ever leave please dont go away tell deep confessions im forever im stay oh miss oh feel love fading away fading away fading away fading away oh please come back eyes shining heart gold oh cant hear love burning growing cold dont ever try wake listen give one chance think time make winds heaven let spirits dance oh miss oh feel love fading away fading away fading away fading away believed id crawl back words youre saying nothing new id crawl knees beg last time im door oh miss oh feel love fading away fading away fading away fading away fading awayyou might also lik
