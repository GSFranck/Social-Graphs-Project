moving aimlessly giving much time future got nothing left runnin restless city find fnatasy looked eyes found lookin back winters sweet love takin dark clouds faded away ooh got tables turnin cant stop fire burnin got ticket take way weatherman says gon na get hot tonight theres fever air cant control im gon na fool love think right never wan na let feeling go weatherman says gon na get hot tonight im gon na fill burnin desire im gon na get lost love cause feel right baby ill raise flame fire lost vision trying read writing wall caught fatal fascination heading fall sweet shining summer angel came rescue shook old suspicion found dream come true repeat chorusyou might also lik
