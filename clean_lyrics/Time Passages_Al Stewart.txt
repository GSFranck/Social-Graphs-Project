late december sky turned snow round day goin slow night like river beginning flow felt beat mind go drifting time passages years go falling fading light time passages buy ticket last train home tonight well im kind live past years run short days fast things lean things dont last well line gets cast time passages theres something back left behind oh time passages buy ticket last train home tonight hear echoes feel starting turn dont know feel theres something learn game play well picture changing youre part crowd theyre laughing something musics loud girl comes towards used know reach hand youre alone time passages know youre youre sight oh time passages buy ticket last train home tonightyou might also lik
