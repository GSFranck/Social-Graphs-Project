sitting home alone trying fall asleep staring hole phone praying rings watching movie youve seen thousand times maybe playing mayer getting lost favorite lines well youre anything like might whatever takes drown noise wan na hear voice im one number away calling said im dying inside got head mess girl confess lied said im leaving coming back might whiskey midnight rain everywhere go see face brain dial everything wan na say im still one number away stuck red light marlboro light lips smoke mirror get clearer without kiss changing station replacing favorite songs well maybe mistake hit brakes moving well youre anything like might whatever takes outrun storm im almost door might also like im one number away calling said im dying inside got head mess girl confess lied said im leaving coming back might whiskey midnight rain everywhere go see face brain dial everything wan na say im still one number away pick call forget loved dont talk wan na hear voice im one number away calling said im dying inside got head mess girl confess lied said im leaving coming back might whiskey midnight rain everywhere go see face brain dial everything wan na say im still one number away away away yeah im still one number away
