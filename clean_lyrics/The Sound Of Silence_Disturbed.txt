hello darkness old friend ive come talk vision softly creeping left seeds sleeping vision planted brain still remains within sound silence restless dreams walked alone narrow streets cobblestone neath halo street lamp turned collar cold damp eyes stabbed flash neon light split night touched sound silence naked light saw ten thousand people maybe people talking without speaking people hearing without listening people writing songs voices never shared one dared disturb sound silence fools said know silence like cancer grows hear words might teach take arms might reach words like silent raindrops fell echoed wells silence people bowed prayed neon god made sign flashed warning words forming sign said words prophets written subway walls tenement halls whispered sound silenceyou might also like
