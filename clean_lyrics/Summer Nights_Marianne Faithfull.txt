oh ive waited long summer nights theres magic air dont care matters summer nights theres little cafe hear music play keep lights turned low place lovers go youll hold tight say love always way summer nights end day go bay together hand hand walk along sand summer nights little cafe well dance night away know love always true eternally moon begins shine see mine summer nights summer nights summer nightsyou might also lik
