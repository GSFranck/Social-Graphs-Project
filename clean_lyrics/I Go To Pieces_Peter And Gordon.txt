see comin street get shaky feel weak tell eyes look way dont seem hear word say go pieces wan na hide go pieces almost die every time baby passes tell arms theyll hold someone new another love true dont listen dont seem care reach shes go pieces wan na hide go pieces almost die every time baby passes remember said said goodbye baby well meet soon maybe best im lonely think go places used go know shell never show hurt much inside hope shes satisfied go pieces wan na hide go pieces almost die every time baby passes might also like go pieces cry every time baby passes go pieces cry every time baby passes
