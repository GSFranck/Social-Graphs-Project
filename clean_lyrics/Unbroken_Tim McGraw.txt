lived breathed loved dont recall walked around bits pieces jagged heart kissed every piece went back place every pain got erased held sunlight feels like one ever left rain cold words still remain unspoken never got lost spent years dark hearts unbroken see smile fill soul unbroken doubted power love baby understand thank god every day wake soft touch magic hands world sometimes thing thats real way make feel babe changes day night swear life one ever left rain cold words still remain unspoken never got lost spent years dark hearts unbroken see smile fill soul unbroken still see night fell eyes made love felt like first time one ever left rain cold words still remain unspoken never got lost spent years dark hearts unbroken see smile fill soul unbroken unbroken unbroken might also like one ever left rain cold words still remain unspoken never got lost spent years dark hearts unbroken one ever left rain cold words still remain unspoken never got lost spent years dark hearts unbroken one ever left rain cold words still remain unspoken
