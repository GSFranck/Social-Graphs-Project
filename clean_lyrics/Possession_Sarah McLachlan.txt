listen wind blows across great divide voices trapped yearning memories trapped time night companion solitude guide would spend forever satisfied would one hold kiss hard ill take breath away wipe away tears close eyes dear world stumble many times betrayed trying find honest word find truth enslaved oh speak riddles speak rhymes body aches breathe breath words keep alive would one hold kiss hard ill take breath away wipe away tears close eyes dear might also like night wander morning dread another day knowing path fear tread oh sea waking dreams follow without pride nothing stands us wont denied would one hold kiss hard ill take breath away wipe away tears close eyes dear hold kiss hard ill take breath away wipe away tears close eyes
