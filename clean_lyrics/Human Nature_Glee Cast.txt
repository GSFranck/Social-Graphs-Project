looking across nighttime city winks sleepless eye hear voice shake window sweet seducing sighs get nighttime four walls wont hold tonight town apple let take bite say tell em human nature way say tell em human nature way yeah reaching touch stranger might also like electric eyes everywhere ooh see girl knows im watching likes way stare say tell em human nature oh way say tell em human nature oh way like livin way like lovin way oh oh oh oh looking across morning citys heart begins beat reaching touch shoulder im dreaming street say tell em hat human nature way doobydoowhy doobydoowhy ooh tell em human nature way like livin way like lovin way oh oh oh oh tell em human nature
