last day june sun demon clouds afraid one ten shade pavement steaming told billy ray red chevrolet needed time thinking walking looked eye swore winking thirtyone seventeen knew nothing love knew everything sat beside front porch swing wondered coming night would bring sun closed eyes climbed skies started swelter sweat trickled front gown thought would melt threw back hair like wasnt sipped julep shoulders bare tried stare looked two lips looked heard softly say know youre young dont know say stay sun gone away chase boy away might also likethen smiled talked awhile walked mile sea sat sands boy took hand saw sun rise man instrumental ten years gone since looked eye memory lingers go back mind first time touch fingers repeat first two verses fade
