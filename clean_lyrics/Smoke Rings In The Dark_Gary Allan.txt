well wont make tell ive come understand youre certain kind woman im different kind man ive tried make love youve tried find spark flame burned somehow turned smoke rings dark loneliness within takes heavy toll burns slow whiskey empty aching soul night like dagger long cold sharp sit front steps blowing smoke rings dark know must going cause loves already gone im taking pieces heart ill leave smoke rings dark rain falls wants wind blows everything earth goes somewhere swear standing still im going wake ill go easy heart ill touch face drift away like smoke rings dark know must going cause loves already gone im taking pieces heart ill leave smoke rings darkyou might also lik
