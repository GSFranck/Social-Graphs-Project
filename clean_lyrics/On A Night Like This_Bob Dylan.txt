night like glad came around hold tight heat coffee grounds got much talk much reminisce sure right night like night like glad youre stay hold pretty miss say youll never go away stray run fingers spine bring touch bliss sure feels right night like night like cant get sleep air cold outside snows deep build fire throw logs listen hiss let burn burn burn burn night like put body next mine keep company plenty aroom please dont elbow let four winds blow around old cabin door im far think theres frost window glass new tender kiss sure feels right night like thisyou might also lik
