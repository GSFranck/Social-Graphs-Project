though never got name time find anything loved though rode different road sang different song ill love till last breaths gone like river made silver everyone came running scene shot cold blood angel blue jeans late night got away chased turnpike lost music never plays though rolled upon stones fell water ill love till judgment day like sunrise made white lies everything nothing seems shot cold blood angel blue jeans hear voices calling around keep falling think heart could pound right see million different ways never leave maze alive woke somebodys arms strange familiar nothing could go wrong barely alive nearly dead somehow awake bed might also like like highway headed way life dream shot love angel blue jeans
