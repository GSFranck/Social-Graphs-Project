let slip away love like autumn sun dyin begun like twilight road ahead dont see goin secrets universe whisper ears years come go take us always may never pass way may never pass way may never pass way dreams say fools let em drift away peace like silent dove flyin begun like columbus olden days must gather courage sail ships open sea cast away fears years come go take us always may never pass way may never pass way may never pass way wan na laugh laughin easy wan na cry makes worthwhile may never pass way thats want might also likecause make feel like im friend like im journey youre journeys end may never pass way thats want baby may never pass way may never pass way may never pass way may never pass way
