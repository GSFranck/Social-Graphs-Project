summer became fall ready winter makes difference cause wear boots summer long eye makeup dark careless circles around eyes sometimes real color skin eyes without shadow call walk gently shadow ones sing night ones sing night ones dream ones walk away capes pulled around tight crying night cry nightbird tonight winters really blankets love sometimes surrounded much love call walk gently though shadow ones sing night ones sing night ones dream ones walk away capes pulled around tight crying night cry nightbird tonight call walk gently though shadow ones sing night ones sing night ones dream ones walk away capes pulled around tight crying night cry nightbird tonight call walk gently though shadow ones sing night ones sing night might also like darkened eyes net lace darkness hard see face pulls back net feel touch fingers see turns eyes see eyes nightbird ones dream finally night bird finally night bird tonight
