first thing heard song outside window traffic wrote words came ringing like christmas bells rapping like pipes drums oh wont stay well put day well wear till night comes woke chelsea morning first thing saw sun yellow curtains rainbow wall blue red green gold welcome crimson crystal beads beckon oh wont stay well put day theres sun show every second curtain opens portrait today streets paved passersby pigeons fly papers lie waiting blow away woke chelsea morning first thing knew milk toast honey bowl orange juice light poured like butterscotch stuck senses oh wont stay well put day well talk present tenses curtain closes rainbow runs away bring incense owls night jewel light candlelight stay oh darling wont wake chelsea morningyou might also lik
