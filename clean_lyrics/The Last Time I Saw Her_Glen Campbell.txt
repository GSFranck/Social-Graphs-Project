eyes bathed starlight hair hung long last time spoke lips like scented flowers inside raindrenched forest long ago scarcely feel way felt time could heal wounds would tear threads away might bleed last time walked laughter steeple bells ring greet morning sun voice ground walked upon good days last time held hand touch autumn spring summer winter last time let go walked away night lost misty streets thousand months thousand years lips kiss eyes million miles beyond moon thats last time saw face eyes bathed starlight million miles beyond moon thats last time saw face eyes bathed starlight walked alone last time kissed cheek lips like wilted leaves might also likeupon autumn covered hills resting frozen ground seeds love lie cold still beneath battered marking stone lies forgotten
