seem caught inside dream life always shadow shoulder theres always voice somewhere saying never try set heart free wish love would come take arms show ive never known could hold someone words like right wrong fade away like yesterday lonely wont leave alone lonely wont leave alone tell wont even let fall love ooh everywhere go always side wont even let fall love try say love words wont come eyes see tears sad memories might also likewhy cant start new leave old feeling far behind guess lonely needs company around bend road im thinking back time rainbows end follow love self delusions find lonely
